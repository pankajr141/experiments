# Introduction
The Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is a physics-based algorithm that uses Newton's law of gravitation to solve optimization problems.

* GSA is classified under population-based method
* Based on law of gravity and mass interactions
* Solutions in GSA are called as agents, these agent interact with each other through gravity force.
* Performance of each agent in population is measured by its mass.
* Each agent (object) move towards other agents (objects) due to gravity force
* This step represent global movements (exploration step) of the object, while the agent with heavier mass move slowly (exploitation step).
* Best solution is the solution with heavier mass

In GSA, the agent has four parameters which are 
* position
* inertial mass
* active gravitational mass
* passive gravitational mass

GSA is a memory-less algorithm. However, it works efficiently like the algorithms with memory

# Algorithm

#### 1. Initialization
   * Each agent in the algorithm has a mass and position.
   * N agents are randomly generated and position of each agent is determined as
     
     <pre>
     X<sub>i</sub>(t) = (x<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup>(t), x<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>(t), ..., x<sub>i</sub><sup>N</sup>(t))
     </pre>
   * Initial values for Gravitation constant (G<sub>o</sub>), α, E and iteration counter t are set.
#### 2. Attraction
   * Particles with lower masses move towards particles with higher masses
#### 3. Iteration: 
   * All agents in population are evaluated best, worst agents are assigned.
   * Gravitation constant (G<sub>o</sub>) is updated
     <pre>
     G(t) = G<sub>o</sub> e<sup>-αt/T</sup>
     </pre>
   * Based on Law of Gravity Force between 2 objects is calculated as
     
     <pre>
     F = G<sub>o</sub> * M1 * M2 / R<sup>2</sup>

     G<sub>o</sub> - Gravitational constant
     M1 - Mass of 1st object
     M2 - Mass of 2nd object
     R - Distance between objects
     </pre>

     In case of Agents gravitional force F<sub>ij</sub> that action on mass i by mass j is defined as

     In case of agent j which act in agent i with force, at time (t), force is calculated as
     <pre>
     F<sub>ij</sub><sup>d</sup> = G(t) * M<sub>pi</sub>(t) * M<sub>aj</sub>(t) * (x<sub>j</sub><sup>d</sup>(t) - x<sub>i</sub><sup>d</sup>(t)) / R<sub>ij</sub>(t)<sup>2</sup> + E

     M<sub>pi</sub>(t) - Passive gravitational mass of agent i
     M<sub>aj</sub>(t) - Active gravitational mass of agent j
     G(t) - gravitational constant
     </pre>

     Above is force action on agent i due to j, similarly we calculate total force by evaluating with all agents and take K agents with best fitness value and biggest mass.
   * Accelaration is calculated as follows

     According to Newton second law, when a force F is applied to an object, the object moves with accelation a depending on applied Force F and object mass M as
     
     <pre>
     a = F / M
     </pre>

     Hence the accelation of object (agent) i is computed as follows

     <pre>
     a<sub>i</sub> = F<sub>ij</sub> / M<sub>ii</sub>
     </pre>
   * Velocity is calculated as follows

     <pre>
     V<sub>i</sub>(t+1) = rand<sub>i</sub> x V<sub>i</sub>(t) + a<sub>i</sub>(t)
     </pre>
   * Position (new) is calculated as follows
     <pre>
     X<sub>i</sub>(t+1) = rand<sub>i</sub> x X<sub>i</sub>(t) + a<sub>i</sub>(t)
     </pre>  
   * The algorithm iterates, and the population eventually gathers around the particles with the highest quality
#### 4. Convergence
   * The algorithm converges to the global optimal solution
